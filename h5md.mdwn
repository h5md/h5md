H5MD format specification version (work version) {#h5md}
================================================

Objective
---------

H5MD stands for "HDF5 for molecular data". H5MD is a specification to store
molecular simulation data and is based on the
[HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) file format [@HDF5]. The primary goal is
to facilitate the portability of said data amongst scientific simulation and
analysis programs.

File format
-----------

H5MD structures are stored in the
[HDF5 file format](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html) version 0
or later. It is recommended to use the HDF5 file format version 2, which
includes the implicit tracking of the creation and modification times of the
file and of each of its objects.

Notation and naming
-------------------

HDF5 files are organized into groups and datasets, summarized as *objects*,
which form a tree structure with the datasets as leaves. Attributes can be
attached to each object. The H5MD specification adopts this naming and uses the
following notation to depict the tree or its subtrees:

`\-- item`
:   An object within a group, that is either a dataset or a group. If it is a
    group itself, the objects within the group are indented by five spaces with
    respect to the group name.

`+-- attribute`
:   An attribute, that relates either to a group or a dataset.

`\-- data: <type>[dim1][dim2]`
:   A dataset with array dimensions `dim1` by `dim2` and of type `<type>`. The
    type is taken from `Enumeration`, `Integer`, `Float` or `String` and follows
    the HDF5 Datatype classes. If the type is not mandated by H5MD, `<type>` is
    indicated. A scalar dataspace is indicated by `[]`.

`(identifier)`
:   An optional item.

`<identifier>`
:   An optional item with unspecified name.

H5MD defines a structure called *H5MD element* (or *element* whenever there
is no confusion). An element is either a time-dependent group or a single
dataset (see time-dependent data below), depending on the situation.

General organization
--------------------

H5MD defines an organization of the HDF5 file or a part thereof into groups,
datasets, and attributes. The root level of the H5MD structure may coincide
with the root of the HDF5 file or be an arbitrary group inside the HDF5 tree. A
number of groups are defined at the H5MD root level. Several levels of
subgroups may exist inside the H5MD structure, allowing the storage and
description of subsystems.

The H5MD structure is allowed to possess non-specified groups, datasets, or
attributes that contain additional information such as application-specific
parameters or data structures, leaving scope for future extensions. Only the
`h5md` group is mandatory at the H5MD root level. All other root groups are
optional, allowing the user to store only relevant data. Inside each group,
every group or dataset is again optional, unless specified differently.

H5MD supports equally the storage of time-dependent and time-independent data,
i.e., data that change in the course of the simulation or that do not. The
choice between those storage types is not made explicit for the elements in the
specification, it has to be made according to the situation. For instance, the
species and mass of the particles are often fixed in time, but in chemically
reactive systems this might not be appropriate.

### Time-dependent data

Time-dependent data consist of a series of samples (or frames) referring to
multiple time steps. Such data are found inside a single dataset and are
accessed via dataset slicing. In order to link the samples to the time axis of
the simulation, H5MD defines a *time-dependent H5MD element* as a group that
contains, in addition to the actual data, information on the corresponding
integer time step and on the physical time. The structure of such a group is:

    <element>
     \-- step
     \-- (time)
     \-- value: <type>[variable][...]

`value`
:   A dataset that holds the data of the time series. It uses a simple
    dataspace whose rank is given by 1 plus the tensor rank of the data stored.
    Its shape is the shape of a single data item prepended by a `[variable]`
    dimension that allows the accumulation of samples during the course of
    time. For instance, the data shape of scalars has the form `[variable]`,
    `D`-dimensional vectors use `[variable][D]`, etc. The first dimension of
    `value` must match the unique dimension of `step` and `time`.

If several H5MD elements are sampled at equal times, `step` and `time` of one
element may be hard links to the `step` and `time` datasets of a different
element. If two elements are sampled at different times (for instance, if one
needs the positions more frequently than the velocities), `step` and `time` are
unique to each of them.

The storage of step and time information follows one of the two modes below,
depending on the dataset layout of `step`.

#### Explicit step and time storage

    <element>
     \-- step: Integer[variable]
     \-- (time: type[variable])
     \-- value: <type>[variable][...]

`step`
:   A dataset with dimensions `[variable]` that contains the time steps at
    which the corresponding data were sampled. It is of `Integer` type to allow
    exact temporal matching of data from one H5MD element to another. The
    values of the dataset are in monotonically increasing order.

`time`
:   An optional dataset that is the same as the `step` dataset, except it is
    `Float` or `Integer`-valued and contains the simulation time in physical units. The
    values of the dataset are in monotonically increasing order.

#### Fixed step and time storage

    <element>
     \-- step: Integer[]
	     +-- (offset: type[])
     \-- (time: type[])
	     +-- (offset: type[])
     \-- value: <type>[variable][...]

`step`
:   A scalar dataset of `Integer` type that contains the increment of the
    time step between two successive rows of data in `value`.

    `offset`
	: A scalar attribute of type `Integer` corresponding to the first sampled
    value of `step`.

`time`
:   An optional scalar dataset that is the same as the `step` dataset, except that
    it is `Float` or `Integer`-valued and contains the increment in simulation
    time, in physical units.

    `offset`
	: A scalar attribute of the same type as `time` corresponding to the first
    sampled value of `time`.

For this storage mode, the explicit value $s(i)$ of the step corresponding to
the $i$-th row of the dataset `value` is $s(i) = i\times\mathrm{step} +
\mathrm{offset}$ where $\mathrm{offset}$ is set to zero if absent.
The corresponding formula for the time $t(i)$ is identical: $t(i) =
i\times\mathrm{time} + \mathrm{offset}$.
The index $i$ is zero-based.

### Time-independent data

H5MD defines a *time-independent H5MD element* as a dataset. As for the
`value` dataset in the case of time-dependent data, data type and array shape
are implied by the stored data, where the `[variable]` dimension is omitted.

### Storage order of arrays

All arrays are stored in C-order as enforced by the HDF5 file format (see
[§ 3.2.5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/12_Dataspaces.html#ProgModel) in
[@HDF5_users_guide]).  A C or C++ program may thus declare `r[N][D]` for the array
of particle coordinates while the Fortran program will declare a `r(D,N)` array
(appropriate index ordering for a system of `N` particles in `D` spatial
dimensions), and the HDF5 file will be the same.

## Storage of particles and tuples lists

### Storage of a list of particles

A list of particles is an H5MD element:

    <list_name>: Integer[N]
     +-- particles_group: Object reference

where `list_name` is a dataset of `Integer` type and dimensions `[N]`, N being
the number of particle indices stored in the list. `particles_group` is an
attribute containing an HDF5 Object Reference as defined by the HDF5 file format
(see
[§ 6.5.2](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/11_Datatypes.html#NonNumDtypes)). `particles_group`
must refer to one of the groups in `/particles`.

If a *fill value* (see
[§ 6.6](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/11_Datatypes.html#Fvalues) in
[@HDF5_users_guide]) is defined for `list_name`, the particles indices in
`list_name` set to this value are ignored.

If the corresponding `particles_group` does not possess the `id` element, the
values in `list_name` correspond to the indexing of the elements in
`particles_group`. Else, the values in `list_name` must be put in correspondence
with the equal values in the `id` element.

### Storage of tuples

A list of tuples is an H5MD element:

    <tuples_list_name>: Integer[N,T]
     +-- particles_group: Object reference

where `N` is the length of the list and `T` is the size of the tuples.  Both `N`
and `T` may indicate variable dimensions. `particles_group` is an attribute
containing an HDF5 Object Reference, obeying the same rules as for the lists of
particles.

The interpretation of the values stored within the tuples is done as for a list
of particles.

If a *fill value* (see
[§ 6.6](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/11_Datatypes.html#Fvalues) in
[@HDF5_users_guide]) is defined, tuples with at least one entry set to this
value are ignored.

### Time-dependence

As the lists of particles and tuples above are H5MD elements, they can be stored
either as time-dependent groups or time-independent datasets.

As an example, a time-dependent list of pairs is stored as:

    <pair_list_name>
       +-- particles_group: Object reference
       \-- value: Integer[variable,N,2]
       \-- step: Integer[variable]

The dimension denoted by `N` may be variable.

H5MD root level
---------------

The root level of an H5MD structure holds a number of groups and is organized
as follows:

    H5MD root
     \-- h5md
     \-- (particles)
     \-- (observables)
     \-- (connectivity)
     \-- (parameters)

`h5md`
:   A group that contains metadata and information on the H5MD structure
    itself. It is the only mandatory group at the root level of H5MD.

`particles`
:   An optional group that contains information on each particle in the system,
    e.g., a snapshot of the positions or the full trajectory in phase space.
    The size of the stored data scales linearly with the number of particles
    under consideration.

`observables`
:   An optional group that contains other quantities of interest, e.g.,
    physical observables that are derived from the system state at given points
    in time. The size of stored data is typically independent of the system
    size.

`connectivity`
:   An optional group that contains the connectivity between particles.

`parameters`
:   An optional group that contains application-specific, custom data such as
    control parameters or simulation scripts.

In subsequent sections, the examples of HDF5 organization may start at the
group level, omitting the display of `H5MD root`.

H5MD metadata
-------------

A set of global metadata describing the H5MD structure is stored in the `h5md`
group as attributes. The contents of the group is:

    h5md
     +-- version: Integer[2]
     \-- author
     |    +-- name: String[]
     |    +-- (email: String[])
     \-- creator
          +-- name: String[]
          +-- version: String[]

`version`
:   An attribute, of `Integer` datatype and of simple dataspace of rank 1 and
    size 2, that contains the major version number and the minor version number
    of the H5MD specification the H5MD structure conforms to.

    The version *x.y.z* of the H5MD specification follows
    [semantic versioning][semver] [@semantic_versioning]: A change of the major
    version number *x* indicates backwards-incompatible changes to the file
    structure. A change of the minor version number *y* indicates
    backwards-compatible changes to the file structure. A change of the patch
    version number *z* indicates changes that have no effect on the file
    structure and serves to allow for clarifications or minor text editing of
    the specification.

    As the *z* component has no impact on the content of a H5MD file, the
    `version` attribute contains only *x* and *y*.

`author`
:   A group that contains metadata on the person responsible for the simulation
    (or the experiment) as follows:

    `name`
    :   An attribute, of fixed-length string datatype and of scalar
        dataspace, that holds the author's real name.

    `email`
    :   An optional attribute, of fixed-length string datatype and
        of scalar dataspace, that holds the author's email address of
        the form `email@domain.tld`.

`creator`
:   A group that contains metadata on the program that created the H5MD
    structure as follows:

    `name`
    :   An attribute, of fixed-length string datatype and of scalar
        dataspace, that stores the name of the program.

    `version`
    :   An attribute, of fixed-length string datatype and of scalar
        dataspace, that yields the version of the program.


### Modules

The H5MD specification can be complemented by modules specific to a
domain of research.  A module may define additional data elements within the
H5MD structure, add conditions that the data must satisfy, or define rules for
their semantic interpretation. Multiple modules may be present, as long as
their prescriptions are not contradictory. Each module is identified by a name
and a version number.

The modules that apply to a specific H5MD structure are stored as subgroups
within the group `h5md/modules`. Each module holds its version number as an
attribute, further module-specific information may be stored:

    h5md
     \-- (modules)
          \-- <module1>
          |    +-- version: Integer[2]
          \-- <module2>
          |    +-- version: Integer[2]
          \-- ...

`version`
:   An attribute, of `Integer` datatype and of simple dataspace of rank 1 and
    size 2, that contains the major version number and the minor version number
    of the module.

    The version *x.y.z* of an H5MD module follows [semantic versioning][semver]
    [@semantic_versioning] and again only the components *x* and *y* are
    stored, see `h5md/version` in "[H5MD metadata]."

[semver]: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html


Particles group
---------------

Information on each particle, i.e., particle trajectories, is stored in the
`particles` group. The `particles` group is a container for subgroups that
represent different subsets of the system under consideration, and it may hold
one or several subgroups, as needed. These subsets may overlap and their union
may be incomplete, i.e., not represent all particles of the simulation volume.
The subgroups contain the trajectory data for each particle as time-dependent
or time-independent data, depending on the situation. Each subgroup contains a
specification of the simulation box, see below. For each dataset, the particle
index is accommodated by the second (first, in the case of time-independence)
array dimension.

The contents of the `particles` group assuming `N` particles in `D`-dimensional
space could be the following:

    particles
     \-- <group1>
          \-- box
          \-- (position)
          |    \-- step: Integer[variable]
          |    \-- time: Float[variable]
          |    \-- value: <type>[variable][N][D]
          \-- (image)
          |    \-- step: Integer[variable]
          |    \-- time: Float[variable]
          |    \-- value: <type>[variable][N][D]
          \-- (species: Enumeration[N])
          \-- ...

The following identifiers for H5MD elements are standardized:

`position`
:   An element that describes the particle positions as coordinate vectors of
    `Float` or `Integer` type.

    If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` (see [below](#simulation-box)) is set
    to `none`, the data indicate for each particle the component $k$ of its
    absolute position in space. If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` is set to
    `periodic`, the data indicate for each particle the component $k$ of the
    absolute position in space of an *arbitrary* periodic image of that particle.

`image`
:   An element that represents periodic images of the box as coordinate vectors
    of `Float` or `Integer` type and allows one to compute for each particle its
    absolute position in space. If `image` is present, `position` must be
    present as well. For time-dependent data, the `step` and `time` datasets of
    `image` must equal those of `position`, which must be accomplished by
    hard-linking the respective datasets.

    If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` (see [below](#simulation-box)) is set
    to `none`, the values of the corresponding component $k$ of `image` serve as
    placeholders. If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` is set to `periodic`,
    for a cuboid box, the component $k$ of the absolute position of particle $i$
    is computed as $R_{ik} = r_{ik} + L_k a_{ik}$, where $\vec r_i$ is taken
    from `position`, $\vec a_i$ is taken from `image`, and $\vec L$ from
    `box/edges`.

`velocity`
:   An element that contains the velocities for each particle as a vector of
    `Float` or `Integer` type.

`force`
:   An element that contains the total forces (i.e., the accelerations
    multiplied by the particle mass) for each particle as a vector of `Float`
    or `Integer` type.

`mass`
:   An element that holds the mass for each particle as a scalar of `Float`
    type.

`species`
:   An element that describes the species for each particle, i.e., its
    atomic or chemical identity, as a scalar of `Enumeration` or `Integer`
    data type. Particles of the same species are assumed to be identical with
    respect to their properties and unbonded interactions.

`id`
:   An element that holds a scalar identifier for each particle of `Integer`
    type, which is unique within the given particle subgroup. The `id` serves
    to identify particles over the course of the simulation in the case when
    the order of the particles changes, or when new particles are inserted and
    removed. If `id` is absent, the identity of the particles is given by their
    index in the `value` datasets of the elements within the same subgroup.

    A *fill value* (see
    [§ 6.6](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/11_Datatypes.html#Fvalues) in
    [@HDF5_users_guide]) may be defined for `id/value` upon dataset creation.
    When the identifier of a particle is equal to this user-defined value,
    the particle is considered non-existing, the entry serves as a
    placeholder. This permits the storage of subsystems whose number of
    particles varies in time. For the case of varying particle number, the
    dimension denoted by `[N]` above may be variable.

`charge`
:   An element that contains the charge associated to each particle as a
    scalar, of `Integer` or `Float` type.

    `charge` has the optional attribute `type` of fixed-length string datatype
    and of scalar dataspace, possible values are `effective` and `formal`. In
    the case `effective`, the charge is part of an effective description of the
    interactions with the precise meaning depending on the underlying empirical
    force fields or coarse-grained models.

    In the case `formal`, the charge is the so-called "formal charge" assigned
    to an atom (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_charge>) and must be
    of `Integer` type. This case corresponds to the entries in PDB files (see
    definition in the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary
    <http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/mmcif_pdbx_v40.dic/Items/_atom_site.pdbx_formal_charge.html>).

	If none of `effective` or `formal` describes the data properly, the
    attribute `type` may be omitted.

Simulation box
--------------

The specification of the simulation box is stored in the group `box`, which
must be contained within each of the subgroups of the `particles` group.
Storing the box information at several places reflects the fact that different
subgroups may be sampled at different time grids. This way, the box information
remains associated to a group of particles.  A specific requirement for `box`
groups inside `particles` is that the `step` and `time` datasets exactly match
those of the corresponding `position` groups, which must be accomplished by
hard-linking the respective datasets.

The spatial dimension and the boundary conditions of the box are stored as
attributes to the `box` group, e.g., :

    particles
     \-- <group1>
          \-- box
               +-- dimension: Integer[]
               +-- boundary: String[D]
               \-- (edges)

`dimension`
:   An attribute that stores the spatial dimension `D` of the simulation box
    and is of `Integer` datatype and scalar dataspace.

`boundary`
:   An attribute, of fixed-length string datatype and of simple dataspace of
    rank 1 and size `D`, that specifies the boundary condition of the box along
    each dimension. The values in `boundary` are either `periodic` or `none`:

    `periodic` The simulation box is periodically continued along the given
    dimension and serves as the unit cell for an infinite tiling of space.

    `none` No boundary condition is imposed. This summarizes the situations of
    open systems (i.e., an infinitely large box) and closed systems (e.g., due
    to an impenetrable wall). For those components where `boundary` is set to
    `none`, the corresponding values of `edges` serve as placeholders.

Information on the geometry of the box edges is stored as an H5MD element,
allowing for the box to be fixed in time or not.  Supported box shapes are the
cuboid and triclinic unit cell, for other shapes a transformation to the
triclinic shape may be considered [@Bekker:1997]. If all values in `boundary`
are `none`, `edges` may be omitted.

`edges`
:   A `D`-dimensional vector or a `D` × `D` matrix, depending on the geometry
    of the box, of `Float` or `Integer` type. If `edges` is a vector, it
    specifies the space diagonal of a cuboid-shaped box. If `edges` is a
    matrix, the box is of triclinic shape with the edge vectors given by the
    rows of the matrix.

    For a time-dependent box, a cuboid geometry is encoded by a dataset `value`
    (within the H5MD element) of rank 2 (1 dimension for the time and 1 for the
    vector) and a triclinic geometry by a dataset `value` of rank 3 (1
    dimension for the time and 2 for the matrix).

    For a time-independent box, a cuboid geometry is encoded by a dataset
    `edges` of rank 1 and a triclinic geometry by a dataset of rank 2.

For instance, a cuboid box that changes in time would appear as:

    particles
     \-- <group1>
          \-- box
               +-- dimension: Integer[]
               +-- boundary: String[D]
               \-- edges
                    \-- step: Integer[variable]
                    \-- time: Float[variable]
                    \-- value: <type>[variable][D]

where `dimension` is equal to `D`. A triclinic box that is fixed in time would
appear as:

    particles
     \-- <group1>
          \-- box
               +-- dimension: Integer[]
               +-- boundary: String[D]
               \-- edges: <type>[D][D]

where `dimension` is equal to `D`.

Observables group
-----------------

Macroscopic observables, or more generally, averages of some property over many
particles, are stored in the root group `observables`. Observables representing
only a subset of the particles may be stored in appropriate subgroups similarly
to the `particles` tree. Each observable is stored as an H5MD element. The
shape of the corresponding dataset (the element itself for time-independent data
and `value` for time-dependent data) is the tensor shape of the observable,
prepended by a `[variable]` dimension for time-dependent data.

The contents of the observables group has the following structure:

    observables
     \-- <observable1>
     |    \-- step: Integer[variable]
     |    \-- time: Float[variable]
     |    \-- value: <type>[variable]
     \-- <observable2>
     |    \-- step: Integer[variable]
     |    \-- time: Float[variable]
     |    \-- value: <type>[variable][D]
     \-- <group1>
     |    \-- <observable3>
     |         \-- step: Integer[variable]
     |         \-- time: Float[variable]
     |         \-- value: <type>[variable][D][D]
     \-- <observable4>: <type>[]
     \-- ...

Connectivity group
------------------

The connectivity information is stored as tuples in the group
`/connectivity`. The tuples are pairs, triples, etc. as needed and may be either
time-independent or time-dependent.
Several connectivity elements may be defined for any particles group.
A connectivity element may only refer to a single particle group.

The tuples of particles are interpreted according to the section
[Storage of particles and tuples lists](#storage-of-particles-and-tuples-lists).

Parameters group
----------------

The `parameters` group stores application-specific, custom data such as control
parameters or simulation scripts. The group consists of groups, datasets, and
attributes; the detailed structure, however, is left unspecified.

The contents of the `parameters` group could be the following:

    parameters
     +-- <user_attribute1>
     \-- <user_data1>
     \-- <user_group1>
     |    \-- <user_data2>
     |    \-- ...
     \-- ...
