H5MD : HDF5 for molecular data
==============================

H5MD is a file format specification, based upon
[HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), aimed at the efficient and
portable storage of molecular data (e.g. simulation trajectories,
molecular structures, ...). H5MD implements data models for a variety of
computational problems, e.g., molecular simulation using molecular
dynamics, or computational fluid dynamics using multi-particle collision
dynamics.

The first official release of the specification will contain particle
trajectories (positions, velocities, forces and species) as well as
thermodynamical observables. Afterwards, extensions will be considered
on the basis of discussion with users of H5MD.

H5MD is developed by Pierre de Buyl, Peter Colberg and Felix Höfling and
is available under the [GNU General Public License version
3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), or any later version.

The draft represents the current state of the specification.
