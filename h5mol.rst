Specifications for the h5mol file format
========================================

Objective
---------

h5mol is aimed at becoming a specification to store molecular simulation data. It is based on the `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>` file format.

It should facilitate portability of said data amongst simulation and analysis programs.

General organization
--------------------

h5mol defines a HDF5 group structure. Inside a group, a number of required fields exist and should possess a conforming name and shape.

Several groups may exist in a file, allowing either the description of several subsystems or the storing of multiple time steps.

The file is allowed to possess non-conforming groups that contain other information such as simulation parameters.

Standardized data elements
--------------------------

* atomic coordinates in 1,2 or 3D
* atomic velocities in 1,2 or 3D
* species identifier (be it a number or a character ?) 


All arrays are stored in C-order as enforced by the HDF5 file format (see `§ 3.2.5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/12_Dataspaces.html#ProgModel>`. A C or C++ program may thus declare r\[N\]\[D\] for the coordinates array while the fortran program will declaire a r(D,N) array (appropriate index ordering for a N atoms D dimensions system) and the hdf5 file will be the same.
